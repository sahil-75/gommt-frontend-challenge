## Assignment
Most people own secondary properties e.g. Villas, homestays, guesthouses etc. They want to rent these properties only to selected guests.

## Terminology
 - Host: One who owns properties such as Villas, homestays, guesthouses
   etc.
 - Guest: Travellers/customers who are willing to stay on these properties for short duration and ready to pay for it.

## Problem Statement

There will be a portal where host can list their properties and guests can browse them. If a guest likes any property, he/she will initiate a "Request to Book" by making upfront payment. Host will then receive an alert for corresponding "Request to Book". Host can see Guest profile who raised this request along with other details such as checkin, checkout, guest count, room count etc. If host likes the profile, he/she can approve "Request to Book" allowing guest to stay on the property or otherwise host can decline the request (payment would then be refunded to guest).

1. Develop a screen where host can list their properties and guest can raise "Request to Book"
2. Also develop a screen where host can see "Request to Book" details along with Guest profile and an option to approve/reject Request.
3. Create dummy APIs for the same. No need to create database.
4. Use any Frontend technologies of your choice (React/Vanilla/React Native/Angular)
5. Use your creativity to convert this problem statement into a working app by adding any other required screens/features (Guest/Host Login or Signup, property onboarding, payment screen, alert to guest on approve/reject etc)
6. Host this assignment on your Github and share repository link with us.
7. Coding practices, Architecture, Modularity etc will carry extra points.
